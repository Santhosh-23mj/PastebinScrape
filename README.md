# PastebinScrape

Scrape pastebin contents based on username
Give it a username, it returns all the links to the pastes of the user.
Also could fetch all data from all the pastes of the user.
Added threading!

```
python3 pastebinscrape.py -u <username>
python3 pastebinscrape.py -u <username> -t 20 -d
```
